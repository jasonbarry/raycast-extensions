# Netlify

This extension allows to search your [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) sites, deploys, domains, and more.

## Getting started

To use this extension, you'll need to [create a personal access token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications/personal). If your Netlify team requires SAML/SSO logins, you'll need to check the "Allow access to my SAML-based team" checkbox for your team's data to appear in Raycast.

You can read more about creating and using personal access tokens in the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/accounts-and-billing/user-settings/#connect-with-other-applications).
